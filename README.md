# Acoustic Motor Failure Detection Frontend

The goal of this project is to provide a easy to use front end to view the results of a machine learning algorithm used to determine the health of a motor through acoutstic input data.

### Layout:

* Login - Simple login page for the website
* Dashboard - Will demonstrate current status of ML
* Testbench - Used to add more training to the ML
